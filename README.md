Control Motor Movement Using Computer Vision

## Description

This project enables the control of motor movement through a Raspberry Pi using computer vision. It captures video from a camera and processes it to recognize specific objects or gestures, which then trigger corresponding motor movements.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV
- cvzone
- RPi.GPIO
- Trained model (keras_model.h5) and labels (labels.txt)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo.git
   cd your-repo
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install opencv-python cvzone RPi.GPIO
   ```

3. Place your trained model (keras_model.h5) and labels (labels.txt) in the project directory.

## Usage

1. Connect your hardware as described in the script (IN1, IN2, IN3, IN4, IN01, IN02, IN03, IN04).

2. Run the script:

   ```bash
   python your_script.py
   ```

3. Follow the instructions displayed on the OpenCV window.

## Features

- Supports real-time video processing
- Recognizes predefined gestures or objects
- Controls motor movement based on recognized input

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues, try the following steps:

- Check your hardware connections.
- Ensure the GPIO pins are set up correctly.
- Verify that the necessary libraries and dependencies are installed.
